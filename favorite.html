        <p>
            <img id="cricket_fav" src="other files/cricket.jpg" alt="">
        One of my favorite pastimes is playing cricket. The thrill of the game, the camaraderie with 
        teammates, and the strategic thinking involved make it an exhilarating experience. From the sound 
        of leather on willow to the rush of taking a wicket or hitting a boundary, every aspect of cricket fills me
        with excitement. Whether it's a friendly match with friends or a more competitive game, I find myself
        completely engrossed in the sport, losing track of time as I immerse myself in the action on the field.</p> 

        <p>
            <img id="web_fav" src="other files/web.png" alt="">
        Another passion of mine is practicing web designing in my free time. The world of web design offers
        endless possibilities for creativity and innovation. I love exploring new design trends, experimenting
        with color palettes, and honing my skills to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
        There's something deeply satisfying about starting with a blank canvas and gradually transforming
        it into a functional and aesthetically pleasing digital platform. Web designing allows me to combine 
        my artistic inclinations with my interest in technology, resulting in a fulfilling and productive use
        of my leisure hours.</p>

        Lastly, strumming the strings of a guitar is yet another source of happiness for me. 
        The soothing melodies and expressive chords allow me to convey emotions and stories through music. 
        Playing the guitar is a therapeutic outlet that helps me unwind and connect with my inner creativity.
        Whether I'm playing alone or jamming with friends, the act of producing harmonious tunes brings a sense 
        of fulfillment that's hard to put into words. All in all, these favorite activities of mine – cricket, 
        web designing, cycling, and playing guitar – each contribute uniquely to my life, enriching my experiences 
        and giving me a well-rounded sense of contentment.</p>
